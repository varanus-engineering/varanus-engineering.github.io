Varanus was founded in 2022 as a senior high engineering and engineering research competitive team. Initially, the team was faced with financial difficulties. Having not allocated project budgets, our ambitions were shut down before they even started.

After months of inactivity, Varanus was re-established in 2023. We decided to move forward, competing under our own budget. Now that we had some initial funding, even if limited, we continued to push forward.

Success soon followed, with Varanus securing third place in our school's first-ever entry to any robotics competition. Remarkably, we achieved this while spending only half of what other teams invested. This achievement proved our skill, determination, and innovation. Varanus soon became the household pioneer in advancing our school's engineering community.

By 2025, the team continued to operate without external capital as it used to. Still, our ambitions do not cease. We plan to specialise in mobile, aquatic, and aerial robotics and vehicles. To achieve our goals, we are adopting the bootstrap approach, focusing on resourcefulness and creativity.

Here at Varanus, we understand how the motivation to innovate can have on shaping the future of society. We have seen how the achievements of established teams has inspired many to start tinkering. With this in mind, we aim to present ourselves as an example that aspiring teams can follow and emulate.
